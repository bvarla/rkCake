                 So glad we found "Raksha's custom cakes". Not only was the cake exactly what we wanted - simple, delicious, good value - working with Anusha was great. She was always very responsive. Coordinating the cake tasting samples was easy. We went with the strawberry cake with Rasberry cream filling and buttercream icing. It was perfect.Definitely recommend. Thank you Anusha!

                 A cake is not just a cake, when it comes to Special Milestone events of our lives. It is the centerpiece of all events, the enabler of the milestone and the most photographed thing in the room....  I had the pleasure of working with this amazing professional Raksha’s Custom Cakes who created such an awesome wedding cake. Not only was it so beautiful, with lot of creative details, it was really very decadent, and tasted heavenly. Knowing that typically multi-tiered cakes cannot be really moist (It would be like the leaning tower of Pisa LOL) , I was surprised with the texture and balance of the 4-tier cake.  Great job 'Raksha’s Custom cakes' “

                 We had a wonderful experience with Raksha Custom cakes. Anusha has been extremely detail oriented and very professional. I came across her cake at my surprise baby shower by my friends and I was pleasantly surprised with the details on the cake and it was very delicious. So I introduced her to my cousin who was getting married couple of months later.She got samples for sampling purposes for my cousin's reception and every sample was so delicious that it became tough to choose. They ended up choosing Butterscotch and Mango-Pineapple flavors for the cake. The design was so gorgeous and the details were extremely intricate .It was the yummiest cake ever.Everyone at the reception was so happy with the cake and the way everything was handled.I would recommend Raksha's Custom cakes to anyone.
